    question: "Is streaming free?",
    answer:
      "Oh yeah, it is 100% FREE! However, there are ads on the video every couple of minutes when you try to click on it. You know, developers need to eat too ;). They are completely harmless, just close the ads when they pop up.",

    question: "Why do some videos say 'Error 404'?",
    answer:
      "I don't know, it works on my computer sooo... just kidding, some videos are unavailable especially when they are recently released. Come back after few days, weeks, or months; maybe they will get uploaded too. If still unsuccessful, proceed to question #3.",

    question: "I'm searching for a Movie/TV show but it shows 0 results",
    answer:
      "Ah, the eternal quest for the perfect binge-watch. If you can't find your beloved show, make sure you are clicking the appropriate button. Click the 'Search Movie' button if you are searching for a movie, and click the 'TV Show' button if you are searching for a TV show. If you are still unsuccessful, go back to question #2.",

    question: "When do you upload new movies?",

  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees or charges?",
    answer:
      "Nope, nada, zilch! My goal is to bring you endless entertainment, not endless bills. So kick back, relax, and let the binge-watching begin!",
